    <h3> Hot wire transient test instrument </h3>
    <p>For my senior design project, my collegues and I worked alongside <a href="https://ctherm.com/">C-Therm</a>, a small company based out of Fredericton, NB, which creates instruments to measure various
      thermal properties of materials. We created hardware and software to interface with their design to create an instrument which could perform the transient hot wire test as outlined in ASTM D7896</p>

    <h3> Syzygy (In Development) </h3>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Syzygy is a puzzle video game I am developing where different types of planets are scattered amongst platforms, 
      and the goal is to sort them by color. However, the planets can only be moved to a single empty slot and across predetermined connections,
       increasing in difficulty as you try to move planets without affecting your sorted ones.

    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Timebender is a video game developed by two colleagues and I in which you play as wizard with the ability to travel between the future and present time. 
      Things take a puzzling turn as you navigate through the walls of the dungeon; items are influenced by which timeline you find yourself in.
